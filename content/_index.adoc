Hey there!

Welcome to my technical writing portfolio! This website showcases my skills in writing clear, concise, and informative technical documentation.

I have been a tech writer at a cybersecurity company for 3 years now, and I have worked on a wide range of projects: open source projects, network appliances, enterprise SaaS products, and API documentation.

The following table describes the writing samples included in this website.

== Writing Philosophy

My approach to technical writing is guided by the principles of structured authoring. This means I focus on:

- *Content Re-use*: I create content that can be used and repurposed across various contexts. This enhances efficiency and ensures consistency.

- *Consistent Structure*: Each piece is meticulously organized with a clear and logical flow, making it easy for readers to navigate and understand.

- *Chunked Information*: I break down complex concepts into smaller, manageable chunks. This allows readers to absorb information in a more digestible manner.

- *Specialized Topics*: Whether it's a task-oriented guide or a conceptual overview, I tailor the content to suit the specific needs of the audience.

== Tools
All the writing samples, including this page, are written in AsciiDocs. To build this website, I used:
