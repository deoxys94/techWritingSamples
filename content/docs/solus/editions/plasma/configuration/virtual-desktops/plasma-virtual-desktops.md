Plasma allows you to have multiple desktops on your computer. 

Virtual desktops are helpful to keep tasks organized and avoid clutter. For example, you could have one virtual desktop for work, one for school, and one for personal use.

Plasma arranges virtual desktops in a grid. You can configure the rows of the grid to suit your needs.

Solus Plasma has one virtual desktop and one row by default.
