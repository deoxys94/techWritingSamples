Solus is an independent, user-friendly operating system designed for home computing. Solus aims to offer a stable and reliable environment while maintaining a modern and up-to-date software library. Additionally, Solus employs a curated rolling release model, ensuring that users always receive updates and security patches.

Here you can find my contributions to the official Solus documentation. The content is exactly the same as the one published in the Solus doc centre, with a couple minor modifications:

- Organization: I broke down the "Configuration" topic into a bunch of smaller task topics.
- Icons: I added inline icons in some of the topics.
